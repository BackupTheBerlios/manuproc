These are those parts of Komponenten's main library which are of 
interest to a wider user group.

This library contains:

- treebase and advanced Class derived from  GTK-CTrees/Gtk-CLists

and perhaps more.

I apologize for not documenting them up to now and (of course) these 
classes have a long history so they sometimes start to smell ...

Use them, improve them, share them.
